In theory, there is no way to know either of these things, since the pigeonhole principle is an assertion of existence not of explicit solution\".

The examples were clear and I appreciated that he showed the math behind the examples instead of assuming we understood. The fact that probably did not come into play was a little strange at first, but after a few minutes of considering it, I saw why that is true. The birthday example that Brother Bessey gave helped me understand why probability does not come into play. Explaining it to my wife was a little challenging as she had trouble understanding that we were dealing with certainty. She liked to think that the chances of there being two were high but using the same birthday example with 366 people she saw that there was a certainty."
