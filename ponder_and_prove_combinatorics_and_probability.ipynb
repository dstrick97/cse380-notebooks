Bretton and I adapted the getCount() function from an online source, and Claire was a huge help in explaining how the functions relate to one another in comparing the number of ones in a bitstring to the number of twos in the prime factorization. While Bretton and Claire ran theirs on laptops, I was able to use the Linux Lab to run mine, and I wonder if that is the cause of our difference in numbers. Brother Neff was kind and took the time to help debug my output file, and in the process I learned about signal handling and running scipts in the background."

You select a third, a fourth, a fifth, etc. Green each time. What is the *minimum* number of marbles you need to select to *exceed* a probability of 99% that you are picking them out of the all-green barrel?
